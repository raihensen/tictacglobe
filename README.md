## Game information

TicTacGlobe is just like Tic Tac Toe -- but made for people who like geography and want to learn the world's countries, capitals, and flags.
Instead of marking the field with a cross or a circle, the two players competing have to guess a country that matches the corresponding row and column.
Rows and columns are made up from different categories, like starting letter, flag color, and other facts about countries.
When you guess wrong, it's your opponent's turn. This means the game is not completely equivalent to Tic Tac Toe - if your opponent knows nothing about geography, you can potentially win with just three fields all marked by you.
Depending on your settings, you can show the number of solutions after or even before making guesses.

## Categories

The game has the following categories:
Starting letter, Ending letter, Capital starting letter, Capital ending letter,
Flag color, Island, Landlocked.

Starting/Ending letter categories exist for all letters that are somehow frequent.
Flag color refers to a color that is contained in the flag, so all countries are contained in at least two of those categories.
Island and Landlocked are simpler categories just containing those countries that are island nations, or landlocked (i.e., have no direct ocean access), respectively.

## Disclaimer

Some countries or territories in our world have disputed recognition. As I was used from other quizzes, I adhered to the country list used by <a href="sporcle.com" target="_blank">sporcle.com</a>. It is not my intention to hurt anybody by featuring or not featuring certain countries.

Some countries have multiple names, multiple capitals, secondary flag colors or other features that are potentially not clearly defined. For these cases, alternative values are sometimes accepted. Click <a href="#">here</a> for a full list of all countries that have alternative values.
